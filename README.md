<b>Getting Started</b>:
From within the project directory in the terminal run the following commands
1) npm install 
2) npm run watch 
  
<b>About the Build Process</b>:<br>
1) npm install - This installs all the packages from within node_modules.
2) npm run watch - Builds the application. You might need to install yarn. 

Keep all the code you right within the src directory. When the project is compiled all the js files get put in the dist directory. The dist folder is what is actually running. 


<b>NOTE</b><br>
I'm going to be changing how it's structured as the semester goes on. I just wanted to get something together that allows us to all start working on it. 

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

> **Note!** Make sure you have already built the app using `npm run watch`

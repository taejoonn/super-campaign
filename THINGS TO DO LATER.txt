- In createCampaign.ts, need to deal with if new lines are entered in questionaire field instead of a question
- Only 1 primary column for some tables? (question and campaign ID)
- Need to change location table
- Edit global parameters (saved in json?)
- The results object dont know which question each answer refers to
- check for location duplicate
- make view globals

- create campaign: when no canvasser/manager entered, campaign will create, but when you view/edit, the locations is blank

FUTURE PROBLEMS:
- edit availability: how does it affect campaign/assignments....do we update it where edit availability is?
    - mark assignment as imcomplete...? or recalculate assignemnt or defer until the manager checks it again and shows error and give them option to recalculate   
    - need to mark dates users are already assigned...
